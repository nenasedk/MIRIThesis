\chapter{MIRI: The Mid-Infrared Instrument}
MIRI is an imaging and spectroscopic instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). It will operate at a temperature of 6.7K to reduce instrumental backgrounds over its wavelength range of 4.8-28.8$\mu$m.

\section{JWST}
JWST is a 6.5m space based observatory that will be located at the L2 Earth-Sun Lagrange point. 
As the successor to the Hubble Space Telescope and the Spitzer Space Telescope, it will provide a new perspective for infrared astronomy. 
It is currently scheduled to launch in March 2021.
