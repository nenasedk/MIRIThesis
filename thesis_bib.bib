IFC specifies virtual representation of building objects as well as their attributes and relationships. Although IFC is an open standard, its complex nature makes information retrieval from an IFC model difficult. This paper proposes an ontology built with Web Ontology Language (OWL) based on IFC specifications to help the information retrieval process from an IFC model. With simple reasoning build into the ontology, an information retrieval system could query the IFC model in XML format directly. The development of the ontology is reviewed and test cases are designed to validate the ontology. Limitations and future studies are also discussed at the end.},

abstract = {We introduce a stable, well tested Python implementation of the affine-invariant ensemble sampler for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) proposed by Goodman {\&} Weare (2010). The code is open source and has already been used in several published projects in the astrophysics literature. The algorithm behind emcee has several advantages over traditional MCMC sampling methods and it has excellent performance as measured by the autocorrelation time (or function calls per independent sample). One major advantage of the algorithm is that it requires hand-tuning of only 1 or 2 parameters compared to {\$}\backslashsim N{\^{}}2{\$} for a traditional algorithm in an N-dimensional parameter space. In this document, we describe the algorithm and the details of our implementation and API. Exploiting the parallelism of the ensemble method, emcee permits any user to take advantage of multiple CPU cores without extra effort.

abstract = {The formation of clouds affects brown dwarf and planetary atmospheres of nearly all effective temperatures. Iron and silicate condense in L dwarf atmospheres and dissipate at the L/T transition. Minor species such as sulfides and salts condense in mid- to late T dwarfs. For brown dwarfs below T eff 450 K, water condenses in the upper atmosphere to form ice clouds. Currently, over a dozen objects in this temperature range have been discovered, and few previous theoretical studies have addressed the effect of water clouds on brown dwarf or exoplanetary spectra. Here we present a new grid of models that include the effect of water cloud opacity. We find that they become optically thick in objects below T eff 350-375 K. Unlike refractory cloud materials, water-ice particles are significantly nongray absorbers; they predominantly scatter at optical wavelengths through the J band and absorb in the infrared with prominent features, the strongest of which is at 2.8 $\mu$m. H2O, NH3, CH4, and H2 CIA are dominant opacity sources; less abundant species may also be detectable, including the alkalis, H2S, and PH3. PH3, which has been detected in Jupiter, is expected to have a strong signature in the mid-infrared at 4.3 $\mu$m in Y dwarfs around T eff = 450 K; if disequilibrium chemistry increases the abundance of PH3, it may be detectable over a wider effective temperature range than models predict. We show results incorporating disequilibrium nitrogen and carbon chemistry and predict signatures of low gravity in planetary mass objects. Finally, we make predictions for the observability of Y dwarfs and planets with existing and future instruments, including the James Webb Space Telescope and Gemini Planet Imager. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {Ultra-cool brown dwarfs offer a unique window into understanding substellar atmospheric physics and chemistry. Their strong molecular absorption bands at infrared wavelengths, Jupiter-like radii, cool temperatures, and lack of complicating stellar irradiation, make them ideal test-beds for understanding Jovian-like atmospheres. Here we report the findings of a uniform atmospheric retrieval analysis on a set of 14 Y and T-dwarfs observed with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 instrument. From our retrieval analysis, we find the temperature-structures to be largely consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium in most objects. We also determine the abundances of water, methane, and ammonia and upper limits on the alkali metals sodium and potassium. The constraints on water and methane are consistent with predictions from chemical equilibrium models, while those of ammonia may be affected by vertical disequilibrium mixing, consistent with previous works. Our key result stems from the constraints on the alkali metal abundances where we find their continued depletion with decreasing effective temperature, consistent with the trend identified in a previous retrieval analysis on a sample of slightly warmer late T-dwarfs in Line et al. (2017). These constraints show that the previously observed Y-J color trend across the T/Y transition is most likely due to the depletion of these metals in accordance with predictions from equilibrium condensate rainout chemistry. Finally, we simulate future James Webb Space Telescope observations of ultra-cool dwarfs and find that the NIRSpec PRISM offers the best chance at developing high-precision constraints on fundamental atmospheric characteristics.},

Powerful Bayesian atmospheric retrieval tools have recently been applied to both exoplanet and brown dwarf spectra to tease out the thermal structures and molecular abundances to understand those processes. In this manuscript we develop a significantly upgraded retrieval method and apply it to the SpeX spectral library data of two benchmark late T dwarfs, Gl 570D and HD 3651B, to establish the validity of our upgraded forward model parameterization and Bayesian estimator. Our retrieved metallicities, gravities, and effective temperatures are consistent with the metallicity and presumed ages of the systems. We add the carbon-to-oxygen ratio as a new dimension to benchmark systems and find good agreement between carbon-to-oxygen ratios derived in the brown dwarfs and the host stars. Furthermore, we have for the first time unambiguously determined the presence of ammonia in the low-resolution spectra of these two late Tdwarfs. We also show that the retrieved results are not significantly impacted by the possible presence of clouds, though some quantities are significantly impacted by uncertainties in photometry. This investigation represents a watershed study in establishing the utility of atmospheric retrieval approaches on brown dwarf spectra.},

Variability at similar or even higher amplitudes has recently been observed in young brown dwarfs and planetary mass objects, which share similar T eff as field brown dwarfs, but have considerably lower surface gravities.

Τ-REx includes the following features:(1) the optimized use of molecular line lists from the ExoMol project; (2) an unbiased atmospheric composition prior selection, through custom built pattern recognition software; (3) the use of two independent algorithms to fully sample the Bayesian likelihood space: nested sampling as well as a more classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach; (4) iterative Bayesian parameter and model selection using the full Bayesian Evidence as well as the Savage-Dickey Ratio for nested models; and (5) the ability to fully map very large parameter spaces through optimal code parallelization and scalability to cluster computing. In this publication we outline the Τ-REx framework and demonstrate, using a theoretical hot-Jupiter transmission spectrum, the parameter retrieval and model selection. We investigate the impact of signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution on the retrievability of individual model parameters, both in terms of error bars on the temperature and molecular mixing ratios as well as its effect on the model's global Bayesian evidence.},

abstract = {T-REx (Tau Retrieval of Exoplanets) is a novel, fully Bayesian atmospheric retrieval code custom built for extrasolar atmospheres. In Waldmann et al., the transmission spectroscopic case was introduced, and here we present the emission spectroscopy spectral retrieval for the T-REx framework. Compared to transmission spectroscopy, the emission case is often significantly more degenerate due to the need to retrieve the full atmospheric temperature-pressure (TP) profile. This is particularly true in the case of current measurements of exoplanetary atmospheres, which are either of low signal-to-noise, low spectral resolution, or both. We present a new way of combining two existing approaches to the modeling of the said TP profile: (1) the parametric profile, where the atmospheric TP structure is analytically approximated by a few model parameters, (2) the layer-by-layer approach, where individual atmospheric layers are modeled. Both of these approaches have distinct advantages and disadvantages in terms of convergence properties and potential model biases. The T-REx hybrid model presented here is a new two-stage TP profile retrieval, which combines the robustness of the analytic solution with the accuracy of the layer-by-layer approach. The retrieval process is demonstrated using simulations of the hot-Jupiter WASP-76b and the hot-super-Earth 55 Cnc e as well as the secondary eclipse measurements of HD 189733b.},

abstract = {We present a retrieval method based on Bayesian analysis to infer the atmospheric compositions and surface or cloud-top pressures from transmission spectra of exoplanets with general compositions. In this study, we identify what can unambiguously be determined about the atmospheres of exoplanets from their transmission spectra by applying the retrieval method to synthetic observations of the super-Earth GJ 1214b. Our approach to inferring constraints on atmospheric parameters is to compute their joint and marginal posterior probability distributions using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique in a parallel tempering scheme. A new atmospheric parameterization is introduced that is applicable to general atmospheres in which the main constituent is not known a priori and clouds may be present. Our main finding is that a unique constraint of the mixing ratios of the absorbers and two spectrally inactive gases (such as N2 and primordial H2+ He) is possible if the observations are sufficient to quantify both (1) the broadband transit depths in at least one absorption feature for each absorber and (2) the slope and strength of the molecular Rayleigh scattering signature. A second finding is that the surface pressure or cloud-top pressure can be quantified if a surface or cloud deck is present at low optical depth. A third finding is that the mean molecular mass can be constrained by measuring either the Rayleigh scattering slope or the shapes of the absorption features, thus enabling one to distinguish between cloudy hydrogen-rich atmospheres and high mean molecular mass atmospheres. We conclude, however, that without the signature of molecular Rayleigh scattering - even with robustly detected infrared absorption features ({\textgreater}10$\sigma$) - there is no reliable way to tell from the transmission spectrum whether the absorber is a main constituent of the atmosphere or just a minor species with a mixing ratio of X abs {\textless} 0.1{\%}. The retrieval method leads us to a conceptual picture of which details in transmission spectra are essential for unique characterizations of well-mixed exoplanet atmospheres. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Several concepts now exist for small, space-based missions to directly characterize exoplanets in reflected light. While studies have been performed that investigate the potential detection yields of such missions, little work has been done to understand how instrumental and astrophysical parameters will affect the ability of these missions to obtain spectra that are useful for characterizing their planetary targets. Here, we develop an instrument noise model suitable for studying the spectral characterization potential of a coronagraph-equipped, space-based telescope. We adopt a baseline set of telescope and instrument parameters appropriate for near-future planned missions like WFIRST-AFTA, including a 2 m diameter primary aperture, an operational wavelength range of 0.4–1.0 $\mu$m, and an instrument spectral resolution of $\lambda$/$\Delta$$\lambda$=70, and apply our baseline model to a variety of spectral models of different planet types, including Earth twins, Jupiter twins, and warm and cool Jupiters and Neptunes. With our exoplanet spectral models, we explore wavelength-dependent planet–star flux ratios for main-sequence stars of various effective temperatures and discuss how coronagraph inner and outer working angle constraints will influence the potential to study different types of planets. For planets most favorable to spectroscopic characterization—cool Jupiters and Neptunes as well as nearby super-Earths—we study the integration times required to achieve moderate signal-to-noise ratio spectra. We also explore the sensitivity of the integration times required to either detect the bottom or presence of key absorption bands (for methane, water vapor, and molecular oxygen) to coronagraph raw contrast performance, exozodiacal light levels, and the distance to the planetary system. Decreasing detector quantum efficiency at longer visible wavelengths makes the detection of water vapor in the atmospheres of Earth-like planets extremely challenging, and also hinders detections of the 0.89 $\mu$m methane band. Additionally, most modeled observations have noise dominated by dark currents, indicating that improving CCD performance could substantially drive down requisite integration times. Finally, we briefly discuss the extension of our models to a more distant future Large UV-Optical-InfraRed (LUVOIR) mission.},

abstract = {We model the impact of non-uniform cloud cover on transit transmission spectra. Patchy clouds exist in nearly every solar system atmosphere, brown dwarfs, and transiting exoplanets. Our major findings suggest that fractional cloud coverage can exactly mimic high mean molecular weight atmospheres and vice-versa over certain wavelength regions, in particular, over the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) bandpass (1.1-1.7 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m). We also find that patchy cloud coverage exhibits a signature that is different from uniform global clouds. Furthermore, we explain analytically why the "patchy cloud-high mean molecular weight" degeneracy exists. We also explore the degeneracy of non-uniform cloud coverage in atmospheric retrievals on both synthetic and real planets. We find from retrievals on a synthetic solar composition hot Jupiter with patchy clouds and a cloud free high mean molecular weight warm Neptune, that both cloud free high mean molecular weight atmospheres and partially cloudy atmospheres can explain the data equally well. Another key find is that the HST WFC3 transit transmission spectra of two well observed objects, the hot Jupiter HD189733b and the warm Neptune HAT-P-11b, can be explained well by solar composition atmospheres with patchy clouds without the need to invoke high mean molecular weight or global clouds. The degeneracy between high molecular weight and solar composition partially cloudy atmospheres can be broken by observing the molecular Rayleigh scattering differences between the two. Furthermore, the signature of partially cloudy limbs also appears as a {\$}\backslashsim{\$}100 ppm residual in the ingress and egress of the transit light curves, provided the transit timing is known to seconds.},

abstract = {With the exception of in situ atmospheric probes, the most useful way to study the atmospheres of other planets is to observe their electromagnetic spectra through remote observations, either from ground-based telescopes or from spacecraft. Atmospheric properties most consistent with these observed spectra are then derived with retrieval models. All retrieval models attempt to extract the maximum amount of atmospheric information from finite sets of data, but while the problem to be solved is fundamentally the same for any planetary atmosphere, until now all such models have been assembled ad hoc to address data from individual missions. In this paper, we describe a new general-purpose retrieval model, Non-linear Optimal Estimator for MultivariatE Spectral analySIS (NEMESIS), which was originally developed to interpret observations of Saturn and Titan from the composite infrared spectrometer on board the NASA Cassini spacecraft. NEMESIS has been constructed to be generally applicable to any planetary atmosphere and can be applied from the visible/near-infrared right out to microwave wavelengths, modelling both reflected sunlight and thermal emission in either scattering or non-scattering conditions. NEMESIS has now been successfully applied to the analysis of data from many planetary missions and also ground-based observations. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This article provides a basic introduction to MCMC methods by establishing a strong conceptual understanding of what problems MCMC methods are trying to solve, why we want to use them, and how they work in theory and in practice. To develop these concepts, I outline the foundations of Bayesian inference, discuss how posterior distributions are used in practice, explore basic approaches to estimate posterior-based quantities, and derive their link to Monte Carlo sampling and MCMC. Using a simple toy problem, I then demonstrate how these concepts can be used to understand the benefits and drawbacks of various MCMC approaches.

abstract = {Exoplanet atmosphere spectroscopy enables us to improve our understanding of exoplanets just as remote sensing in our own solar system has increased our understanding of the solar system bodies. The challenge is to quantitatively determine the range of temperatures and molecular abundances allowed by the data, which is often difficult given the low information content of most exoplanet spectra that commonly leads to degeneracies in the interpretation. A variety of spectral retrieval approaches have been applied to exoplanet spectra, but no previous investigations have sought to compare these approaches. We compare three different retrieval methods: optimal estimation, differential evolution Markov chain Monte Carlo, and bootstrap Monte Carlo on a synthetic water-dominated hot Jupiter. We discuss expectations of uncertainties in abundances and temperatures given current and potential future observations. In general, we find that the three approaches agree for high spectral resolution, high signal-to-noise data expected to come from potential future spaceborne missions, but disagree for low-resolution, low signal-to-noise spectra representative of current observations. We also compare the results from a parameterized temperature profile versus a full classical Level-by-Level approach and discriminate in which situations each of these approaches is applicable. Furthermore, we discuss the implications of our models for the inferred C-to-O ratios of exoplanetary atmospheres. Specifically, we show that in the observational limit of a few photometric points, the retrieved C/O is biased toward values near solar and near one simply due to the assumption of uninformative priors. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Thermal emission spectra of exoplanets provide constraints on the chemical compositions, pressure-temperature (P-T) profiles, and energy transport in exoplanetary atmospheres. Accurate inferences of these properties rely on the robustness of the atmospheric retrieval methods employed. While extant retrieval codes have provided significant constraints on molecular abundances and temperature profiles in several exoplanetary atmospheres, the constraints on their deviations from thermal and chemical equilibria have yet to be fully explored. Our present work is a step in this direction. We report HyDRA, a disequilibrium retrieval framework for thermal emission spectra of exoplanetary atmospheres. The retrieval code uses the standard architecture of a parametric atmospheric model coupled with Bayesian statistical inference using the nested sampling algorithm. For a given data set, the retrieved compositions and P-T profiles are used in tandem with the GENESIS self-consistent atmospheric model to constrain layer-by-layer deviations from chemical and radiative-convective equilibrium in the observable atmosphere. We demonstrate HyDRA on the hot JupiterWASP-43b with a high-precision emission spectrum. We retrieve an H2O mixing ratio of log (H2O) = -3.54-0.52+0.82, consistent with previous studies. We detect H2O and a combined CO/CO2 at 8s significance. We find the dayside P-T profile to be consistent with radiative-convective equilibrium within the 1s limits and with low day-night redistribution, consistent with previous studies. The derived compositions are also consistent with thermochemical equilibrium for the corresponding distribution of P-T profiles. In the era of high-precision and high-resolution emission spectroscopy, HyDRA provides a path to retrieve disequilibrium phenomena in exoplanetary atmospheres.},

abstract = {Interpretations of exoplanetary transmission spectra have been undermined by apparent obscuration due to clouds/hazes.

Assertions of solar H{\$}{\_}2{\$}O abundances have relied on making a priori model assumptions, e.g. chemical/radiative equilibrium.

We demonstrate that this prescription allows one to break vital degeneracies between clouds and prominent molecular abundances.

abstract = {Recent spectroscopic observations of transiting hot Jupiters have permitted the derivation of the thermal structure and molecular abundances of H 2 O, CO 2 , CO and CH 4 in these extreme atmospheres. Here, for the first time, we apply the technique of optimal estimation to determine the thermal structure and composition of an exoplanet by solving the inverse problem. The development of a suite of radiative transfer and retrieval tools for exoplanet atmospheres is described, building upon a retrieval algorithm which is extensively used in the study of our own Solar system. First, we discuss the plausibility of detection of different molecules in the dayside atmosphere of HD189733b and the best-fitting spectrum retrieved from all publicly available sets of secondary eclipse observations between 1.45 and 24$\mu$m. Additionally, we use contribution functions to assess the vertical sensitivity of the emission spectrum to temperatures and molecular composition. Over the altitudes probed by the contribution functions, the retrieved thermal structure shows an isothermal upper atmosphere overlying a deeper adiabatic layer (temperature decreasing with altitude), which is consistent with previously reported dynamical and observational results. The formal uncertainties on retrieved parameters are estimated conservatively using an analysis of the cross-correlation functions and the degeneracy between different atmospheric properties. The formal solution of the inverse problem suggests that the uncertainties on retrieved parameters are larger than suggested in previous studies, and that the presence of CO and CH 4 is only marginally supported by the available data. Nevertheless, by including as broad a wavelength range as possible in the retrieval, we demonstrate that available spectra of HD189733b can constrain a family of potential solutions for the atmospheric structure. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) will measure exoplanet transmission and eclipse spectroscopy at un-precedented precisions to better understand planet structure, dynamics, chemistry and formation. These are essential tools on the march towards biosignature searches on potentially habitable planets. We explore a range of exoplanet atmospheric conditions and forecast the expected results with JWST. We take realistic CHIMERA models that match existing Spitzer and HST results and simulate the spectra achievable with the JWST MIRI + NIRCam Guaranteed Time Observations (GTO) survey. We then retrieve atmospheric parameters from these spectra to estimate the precision to which the planets' atmospheric compositions can be measured. We find that emission spectra have well-constrained unimodal solutions but transmission spectra near 10X solar abundance and solar C/O ratios can suffer from bimodal solutions. Broad wavelength coverage as well as higher precision data can resolve bimodal solutions and provide dramatically better atmospheric parameter constraints. We find that metallicities can be measured to within 20{\%} to 170{\%}, which approaches the precisions on Solar System planets, and C/O ratios can be constrained to {\~{}}10{\%} to 60{\%}, assuming that observers can leverage short wavelength data to select the correct solution from the bimodal posteriors. These compositional precisions are sufficient to validate or refute predictions from disk formation models on final atmospheric abundances as long as their history is not erased by planet evolution processes. We also show the extent to which eclipse mapping with JWST is possible on our brightest system HD 189733 b.},

abstract = {Absorption lines from water, methane, and carbon monoxide are detected in the atmosphere of exoplanet HR 8799 b. A medium-resolution spectrum presented here shows well-resolved and easily identified spectral features from all three molecules across the K band. The majority of the lines are produced by CO and H2O, but several lines clearly belong to CH4. Comparisons between these data and atmosphere models covering a range of temperatures and gravities yield log mole fractions of H2O between -3.09 and -3.91, CO between -3.30 and -3.72, and CH4 between -5.06 and -5.85. More precise mole fractions are obtained for each temperature and gravity studied. A reanalysis of H-band data, previously obtained at a similar spectral resolution, results in a nearly identical water abundance as determined from the K-band spectrum. The methane abundance is shown to be sensitive to vertical mixing and indicates an eddy diffusion coefficient in the range of 106-108 cm2 s-1, comparable to mixing in the deep troposphere of Jupiter. The model comparisons also indicate a carbon-to-oxygen ratio (C/O) between ∼0.58 and 0.7, encompassing previous estimates for a second planet in the same system, HR 8799 c. Super-stellar C/O could indicate planet formation by core-accretion; however, the range of possible C/O for these planets (and the star) is currently too large to comment strongly on planet formation. More precise values of the bulk properties (e.g., effective temperature and surface gravity) are needed for improved abundance estimates.},

abstract = {Matching spectra is necessary for database searches, assessing the source of an unknown sample, structure elucidation, and classification of spectra. A direct method of matching is to compare, point by point, two digitized spectra, the outcome being a parameter that quantifies the degree of similarity or dissimilarity between the spectra. Examples studied here are correlation coefficient squared and Euclidean cosine squared, both applied to the raw spectra and first-difference values of absorbance. It is shown that spectra do not fulfill the requirements for a normal statistical interpretation of the correlation coefficient; in particular, they are not normally distributed variables. It is therefore not correct to use a Student's t-test to calculate the probability of the null hypothesis that two spectra are not correlated on the basis of a correlation coefficient between them. We have investigated the effect on the similarity indices of systematically changing the mean and standard deviation of a single Gaussian peak relative to a reference Gaussian peak, of changing one peak, and of changing many peaks, in a simulated 10-peak spectrum. Squared Euclidean cosine is least sensitive to changes and the first-difference methods are most sensitive to changes in mean and standard deviation of peaks. A shift of the center of a peak has a greater effect on the indices than increases in peak width, but a decrease in peak width does lead to significant changes in the indices. We recommend that if these indices are to be used to match spectra, appropriate windows should be chosen to avoid dilution by regions with no significant change. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Sophisticated atmospheric retrieval algorithms, such as Nested Sampling, explore large parameter spaces by iterating over millions of radiative transfer (RT) calculations. Probability distribution functions for retrieved parameters are highly sensitive to assumptions made within the RT forward model. One key difference between RT models is the computation of the gaseous absorption throughout the atmosphere. We compare two methods of calculating gaseous absorption, cross-sections and correlated-{\$}k{\$}, by examining their resulting spectra of a number of typical $\backslash$ce{\{}H2{\}}-He dominated exoplanetary and brown dwarf atmospheres. We also consider the effects of including $\backslash$ce{\{}H2{\}}-He pressure-broadening in some of these examples. We use NEMESIS to compute forward models. Our {\$}k{\$}-tables are verified by comparison to ExoMol cross-sections provided online and a line-by-line calculation. For test cases with typical resolutions ({\$}\backslashDelta \backslashnu = 1{\$}cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), we show that the cross-section method overestimates the amount of absorption present in the atmosphere and should be used with caution. For mixed-gas atmospheres the morphology of the spectra changes, producing `ghost' features. The two methods produce differences in flux of up to a few orders of magnitude. The addition of pressure broadening of lines adds up to an additional order of magnitude change in flux. These effects are more pronounced for brown dwarfs and secondary eclipse geometries. We note that correlated-{\$}k{\$} can produce similar results to very high-resolution cross-sections, but is much less computationally expensive. We conclude that inaccurate use of cross-sections and omission of pressure broadening can be key sources of error in the modelling of brown dwarf and exoplanet atmospheres.},

abstract = {We present the easy-to-use, publicly available, Python package petitRADTRANS, built for the spectral characterization of exoplanet atmospheres. The code is fast, accurate, and versatile; it can calculate both transmission and emission spectra within a few seconds at low resolution ({\$}\backslashlambda/\backslashDelta\backslashlambda{\$} = 1000; correlated-k method) and high resolution ({\$}\backslashlambda/\backslashDelta\backslashlambda = 10{\^{}}6{\$}; line-by-line method), using only a few lines of input instruction. The somewhat slower correlated-k method is used at low resolution because it is more accurate than methods such as opacity sampling. Clouds can be included and treated using wavelength-dependent power law opacities, or by using optical constants of real condensates, specifying either the cloud particle size, or the atmospheric mixing and particle settling strength. Opacities of amorphous or crystalline, spherical or irregularly-shaped cloud particles are available. The line opacity database spans temperatures between 80 and 3000 K, allowing to model fluxes of objects such as terrestrial planets, super-Earths, Neptunes, or hot Jupiters, if their atmospheres are hydrogen-dominated. Higher temperature points and species will be added in the future, allowing to also model the class of ultra hot-Jupiters, with equilibrium temperatures {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eq{\}} \backslashgtrsim 2000{\$} K. Radiative transfer results were tested by cross-verifying the low- and high-resolution implementation of petitRADTRANS, and benchmarked with the petitCODE, which itself is also benchmarked to the ATMO and Exo-REM codes. We successfully carried out test retrievals of synthetic JWST emission and transmission spectra (for the hot Jupiter TrES-4b, which has a {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eq{\}}{\$} of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1800 K).

Correlated-k may be justified in special cases but, otherwise, numerical comparisons must be made with exact calcualtions. Comparisons for scattering and absorbing atmospheres containing CO2, H2O and O3 lead to the following conclusions: (i) the errors in correlated-k are generally of order of magnitude 1{\%}. (ii) Much larger errors occur only when a radiative quantity is very much smaller than its average value. (iii) Errors do not depend systematically on the gas molecule, the distributions of gases and aerosols, or on the aerosol optical properties. (iv) Errors do not systematically increase with the order of differencing. We show that the multiplication property for the transmission by overlapping bands can be incorporated into correlated-k; that temperature effects can be interpolated on a coarse grid; and that 10 quadrature points are often sufficient to average over complex spectral intervals containing thousands of lines. Correlated-k is well suited to iterative methods involved in the inversion of satellite radiances or in numerical weather or climate models. {\textcopyright} 1989.},

abstract = {Exoplanetary atmospheric retrieval refers to the inference of atmospheric properties of an exoplanet given an observed spectrum. The atmospheric properties include the chemical compositions, temperature profiles, clouds/hazes, and energy circulation. These properties, in turn, can provide key insights into the atmospheric physicochemical processes of exoplanets as well as their formation mechanisms. Major advancements in atmospheric retrieval have been made in the last decade, thanks to a combination of state-of-the-art spectroscopic observations and advanced atmospheric modeling and statistical inference methods. These developments have already resulted in key constraints on the atmospheric H2O abundances, temperature profiles, and other properties for several exoplanets. Upcoming facilities such as the JWST will further advance this area. The present chapter is a pedagogical review of this exciting frontier of exoplanetary science. The principles of atmospheric retrievals of exoplanets are discussed in detail, including parametric models and statistical inference methods, along with a review of key results in the field. Some of the main challenges in retrievals with current observations are discussed along with new directions and the future landscape.},

abstract = {The Mid-Infrared instrument (MIRI) on board the James Webb Space Telescope will perform the first ever characterization of young giant exoplanets observed by direct imaging in the 5-28 microns spectral range. This wavelength range is key for both determining the bolometric luminosity of the cool known exoplanets and for accessing the strongest ammonia bands. In conjunction with shorter wavelength observations, MIRI will enable a more accurate characterization of the exoplanetary atmospheric properties. Here we consider a subsample of the currently known exoplanets detected by direct imaging and we discuss their detectability with MIRI, either using the coronagraphic or the spectroscopic modes. By using the Exo-REM atmosphere model we calculate the mid-infrared emission spectra of fourteen exoplanets, and we simulate MIRI coronagraphic or spectroscopic observations. Specifically we analyze four coronagraphic observational setups, which depend on (i) the target-star and reference-star offset (0, 3, 14 mas), (ii) the wave-front-error (130, 204 nm rms), (iii) the telescope jitter amplitude (1.6, 7 mas). We then determine the signal-to-noise and integration time values for the coronagraphic targets whose planet-to-star contrasts range from 3.9 to 10.1 mag. We conclude that all the MIRI targets should be observable with different degrees of difficulty, which depends on the final in-flight instrument performances. Furthermore, we test for detection of ammonia in the atmosphere of the coolest targets. Finally, we present the case of HR 8799 b to discuss what MIRI observations can bring to the knowledge of a planetary atmosphere, either alone or in combination with shorter wavelength observations.},

The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on-board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) performs mediumresolution spectroscopy in the 5 to 28.5micron wavelength range. In this paper two algorithms are presented that will be used to extract 1D spectra from the 2D absolutely calibrated detector science frames acquired with the Medium-Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) of MIRI. The first spectral extraction algorithm performs standard aperture photometry on point and extended sources. The second algorithm, applicable only to point sources, uses the instrument point spread function (PSF) and the pixel signal variance as a weighting function, to extract the signal from the detector pixels in an optimized way. This »optimal» extraction is also optimal in the case of faint source observations. The two algorithms are tested on MIRI ground test data and compared. For point sources, the optimal extraction algorithm is found to be more reliable than the aperture extraction algorithm.},

abstract = {Space-based high contrast imaging mission concepts for studying rocky exoplanets in reflected light are currently under community study. We develop an inverse modeling framework to estimate the science return of such missions given different instrument design considerations. By combining an exoplanet albedo model, an instrument noise model, and an ensemble Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler, we explore retrievals of atmospheric and planetary properties for Earth twins as a function of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and resolution ({\$}R{\$}). Our forward model includes Rayleigh scattering, single-layer water clouds with patchy coverage, and pressure-dependent absorption due to water vapor, oxygen, and ozone. We simulate data at {\$}R = 70{\$} and {\$}R = 140{\$} from 0.4-1.0 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m with SNR {\$} = 5, 10, 15, 20{\$} at 550 nm (i.e., for HabEx/LUVOIR-type instruments). At these same SNR, we simulate data for WFIRST paired with a starshade, which includes two photometric points between 0.48-0.6 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m and {\$}R = 50{\$} spectroscopy from 0.6-0.97 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. Given our noise model for WFIRST-type detectors, we find that weak detections of water vapor, ozone, and oxygen can be achieved with observations with at least {\$}R = 70{\$} / SNR{\$}\backslash = 15{\$}, or {\$}R = 140{\$} / SNR{\$}\backslash = 10{\$} for improved detections. Meaningful constraints are only achieved with {\$}R = 140{\$} / SNR{\$}\backslash = 20{\$} data. The WFIRST data offer limited diagnostic information, needing at least SNR = 20 to weakly detect gases. Most scenarios place limits on planetary radius, but cannot constrain surface gravity and, thus, planetary mass.},

abstract = {Planets residing in circumstellar habitable zones (CHZs) offer our best opportunities to test hypotheses of life's potential pervasiveness and complexity. Constraining the precise boundaries of habitability and its observational discriminants is critical to maximizing our chances at remote life detection with future instruments. Conventionally, calculations of the inner edge of the habitable zone (IHZ) have been performed using both 1D radiative-convective and 3D general circulation models. However, these models lack interactive three-dimensional chemistry and do not resolve the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) region of the upper atmosphere. Here we employ a 3D high-top chemistry-climate model (CCM) to simulate the atmospheres of synchronously-rotating planets orbiting at the inner edge of habitable zones of K- and M-dwarf stars (between {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}} ={\$} 2600 K and 4000 K). While our IHZ climate predictions are in good agreement with GCM studies, we find noteworthy departures in simulated ozone and HO{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm x{\}}{\$} photochemistry. For instance, climates around inactive stars do not typically enter the classical moist greenhouse regime even with high ({\$}{\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} mol mol{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) stratospheric water vapor mixing ratios, which suggests that planets around inactive M-stars may only experience minor water-loss over geologically significant timescales. In addition, we find much thinner ozone layers on potentially habitable moist greenhouse atmospheres, as ozone experiences rapid destruction via reaction with hydrogen oxide radicals. Using our CCM results as inputs, our simulated transmission spectra and secondary eclipse thermal emission spectra show that both water vapor and ozone features of these atmospheres could be detectable by instruments NIRSpec and MIRI LRS aboard the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 SPIE. The Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MRS) is the only mid-IR Integral Field Spectrometer on board James Webb Space Telescope. The complexity of the MRS requires a very specialized pipeline, with some specific steps not present in other pipelines of JWST instruments, such as fringe corrections and wavelength offsets, with different algorithms for point source or extended source data. The MRS pipeline has also two different variants: the baseline pipeline, optimized for most foreseen science cases, and the optimal pipeline, where extra steps will be needed for specific science cases. This paper provides a comprehensive description of the MRS Calibration Pipeline from uncalibrated slope images to final scientific products, with brief descriptions of its algorithms, input and output data, and the accessory data and calibration data products necessary to run the pipeline.},

abstract = {Characterizing the atmospheres of extrasolar planets is the new frontier in exoplanetary science. The last two decades of exoplanet discoveries have revealed that exoplanets are very common and extremely diverse in their orbital and bulk properties. We now enter a new era as we begin to investigate the chemical diversity of exoplanets, their atmospheric and interior processes, and their formation conditions. Recent developments in the field have led to unprecedented advancements in our understanding of atmospheric chemistry of exoplanets and the implications for their formation conditions. We review these developments in the present work. We review in detail the theory of atmospheric chemistry in all classes of exoplanets discovered to date, from highly irradiated gas giants, ice giants, and super-Earths, to directly imaged giant planets at large orbital separations. We then review the observational detections of chemical species in exoplanetary atmospheres of these various types using different methods, including transit spectroscopy, doppler spectroscopy, and direct imaging. In addition to chemical detections, we discuss the advances in determining chemical abundances in these atmospheres and how such abundances are being used to constrain exoplanetary formation conditions and migration mechanisms. Finally, we review recent theoretical work on the atmospheres of habitable exoplanets, followed by a discussion of future outlook of the field.},

abstract = {The advent of large-scale spectroscopic surveys underscores the need to develop robust techniques for determining stellar properties ("labels", i.e., physical parameters and elemental abundances). However, traditional spectroscopic methods that utilize stellar models struggle to reproduce cool ({\$}{\textless}{\$}4700 K) stellar atmospheres due to an abundance of unconstrained molecular transitions, making modeling via synthetic spectral libraries difficult. Because small, cool stars such as K and M dwarfs are both common and good targets for finding small, cool planets, establishing precise spectral modeling techniques for these stars is of high priority. To address this, we apply The Cannon, a data-driven method of determining stellar labels, to Keck High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES) spectra of 141 cool ({\$}{\textless}{\$}5200 K) stars from the California Planet Search. Our implementation is capable of predicting labels for small ({\$}{\textless}{\$}1 {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) stars of spectral types K and later with accuracies of 68 K in effective temperature ({\$}T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}), 5{\%} in stellar radius ({\$}R{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$}), and 0.08 dex in bulk metallicity ([Fe/H]), and maintains this performance at low spectral resolutions ({\$}R{\$} {\$}{\textless}{\$} 5000). As M-dwarfs are the focus of many future planet-detection surveys, this work can aid efforts to better characterize the cool star population and uncover correlations between cool star abundances and planet occurrence for constraining planet formation theories.},

abstract = {In the last decade, about a dozen giant exoplanets have been directly imaged in the IR as companions to young stars. With photometry and spectroscopy of these planets in hand from new extreme coronagraphic instruments such as SPHERE at VLT and GPI at Gemini, we are beginning to characterize and classify the atmospheres of these objects. Initially, it was assumed that young planets would be similar to field brown dwarfs, more massive objects that nonetheless share similar effective temperatures and compositions. Surprisingly, young planets appear considerably redder than field brown dwarfs, likely a result of their low surface gravities and indicating much different atmospheric structures. Preliminarily, young free-floating planets appear to be as or more variable than field brown dwarfs, due to rotational modulation of inhomogeneous surface features. Eventually, such inhomogeneity will allow the top of atmosphere structure of these objects to be mapped via Doppler imaging on extremely large telescopes. Direct imaging spectroscopy of giant exoplanets now is a prelude for the study of habitable zone planets. Eventual direct imaging spectroscopy of a large sample of habitable zone planets with future telescopes such as LUVOIR will be necessary to identify multiple biosignatures and establish habitability for Earth-mass exoplanets in the habitable zones of nearby stars.},
